    <details> <summary> <h3> Long Live the Web </h3></summary><p>
      In ‚ÄúLong Live the Web,‚Äù I found it interesting that the author said that most people think of the web as similar to nature, that if something is chipping away, that we cannot fix it. But that we actually can, because we made the web. I think this is interesting because as opposed to thinking of it as nature I thought of it as something too vast to control? That it has too much in it and on it. I also liked how much he emphasized universality because like Tim Berners Lee says, it is something I take for granted- the freedom we are allowed due to the web. I also found it interesting that he called out big companies for creating closed worlds since that is how they make money.

    <details> <summary><h3> As We May Think </h3> </summary>

    <p> In ‚ÄúAs We May Think‚Äù I liked how the author shuffled through history and different inventions while speaking about what science offers to us. I like how he zoomed in on innovative scientists like Babbage and inventions like photography through the years. I also liked how each section skimmed through a defining aspect of a scientist like logic or stringed from the previous section into a new era and new topic. I liked the last section when they talked about man using the past to analyze his current problems well through the use of science. I think this is interesting because history and science are linked inextricably and that as we step forward in the future, the past is relevant. However, sometimes with our rate of progress we tend to forget that.
