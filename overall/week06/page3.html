   At first his language was so complicated and dense it was difficult for me to understand. I did not even understand what the spectacle was. But I think he is referring to system that we are all tangled up in. It was interesting that Guy Dermond wrote this in 1967 and yet it was able to accurately predict so many things.

   The idea that the spectacle is not a collection of images but mediated by images was so interesting to me since today we are bombarded with more media than we can handle. We are more aware and connected in terms of events or knowing what's going on around the world but we are also alienated at the same time.

 Overall, his theses felt very real but also pessimistic. He often talks about what reality really is (which was a bit confusing to me, especially when he talks about true and false.) However, one thing that spoke to me was how everyone's life is run by the economy. Sure we say we have a social life but in the end we throw fuel in the economy in order to have fuel to survive. It's like the spectacle is so deeply entangled in our lives we can't live without it. We must work to live.
