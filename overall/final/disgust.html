    <h2> Controlling People </h2>
 <p>Freedom is really important to me. </p>
 <p> When my friends tell me of controlling relationships they’re in, my blood boils.</p>
 <p> They deserve better.</p>
 <p> They don’t deserve to be emotionally blackmailed into staying in a place they’re not happy.</p>
 <p>Often, I realize that situations are complicated but, I hope everyone can claim their own freedom, someday.</p>

    <h2> Manipulation </h2>
   <p>I have been lucky to meet mostly nice humans through my life.</p>
   <p> But there have been many people who smile and lie through their teeth and then emotionally blackmail you into getting things done their way.</p>
   <p> It was really scary when it happened to me.</p>
   <p> The girl who manipulated me was someone who I put on a pedestal and admired. </p>
   <p>Worst of all, I don’t even think I knew I was being manipulated.</p>

    <h2> Low Self-Esteem </h2>
    <p>I am disgusted at my own lack of self-esteem.</p>
    <p> I’ve been trying for the past few years to get it higher and it has slowly begun to improve.</p>
    <p> But in general I often struggle to step up and make even simple decisions.</p>
    <p> I can’t even accept compliments properly. </p>
    <p>I think I’ve gotten better at just saying “Thank you.” but my self-esteem levels have a while to go.</p>

    <h2>   Sexism in Movies </h2>

<p>Especially in Indian movies, I’m disgusted by how much women are shamed on screen either in terms of their body, colorism or their job.</p>
<p> They are constantly degraded in these movies, not given substantial characters and are objectified.</p>
<p> And it hurts since I watched a lot of Indian movies growing up and even worshipped some really problematic ones as a kid :(((</p>

   <p>ahaha so Coronavirus has left me thinking showering is optional oops.. </p>
   <p> *awkward silence since the audience is disgusted by Neha* </p>
   <p>So I’m disgusted at my lack of hygiene :((</p>
