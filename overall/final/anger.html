    <h2> A+ </h2>
 <p> In high school there would be those kids who got a 98 and then would complain about how terribly they did. </p>
 <p>I want to SCREAM. </p>
 <p>On top of that, they’ll say that they didn’t study at all. Seriously bro? </p>
<p>I also get mad at people who say they’ll just wing it and then they do great. </p>
<p>Cause I prepared all of last night for the same assignment?! Excuse me?</p>

    <h2> Overthinking </h2>
    <p> An example would be when I overthink one little thing I said or did that could’ve hurt someone else.</p>
    <p> I sit and berate myself for hours.</p>
    <p> Then I text the person a long apology about my dumb behavior and they’re like, “really? When did you say that? I didn’t notice.” or something. </p>
    <p>And then I just feel stupid. 
    </p><!-- But in general I tiptoe when I’m speaking to others, very hesitant to be honest with all of my criticism. -->

    <h2> Rock </h2>
    <p> I always like being people’s rock. </p>
    <p>I get sad and kinda mad when one of my best friends are going through something and I didn't know.</p>
    <p> I feel awful. </p>
    <p> They were hit with crappy situations left and right.</p>
    <p> And I had no idea.</p> 
    <p>I wasn’t able to help out.</p>
    <p> I was so ignorant and stupid.</p>

    <h2> Door Mat </h2>
    <p>When people speak over me, I get a little mad.</p>
    <p> I think I always ignore this since I often interrupt others and I get mad at myself for it. </p>
    <p>But often since I love listening to people’s stories, they’ll talk so much that there’s no room for me to say anything.</p> 
   <p> But in general I tiptoe when I’m speaking to others, very hesitant to be honest with all of my thoughts.</p>

    <h2> Maturity? </h2>
    <p>People have called me innocent many times, inferring I’m childish since I didn’t understand dirty jokes. </p>
    <p>I used to be deeply offended by it. I still am to an extent.</p>
    <p> “Aw Neha won’t be able to handle that,” when we watched a movie that was very emotional or dark.</p>
    <p> They just make assumptions about what I can handle.</p>
    <p> It just pisses me off. I’ve gone through a lot too.</p>
    <p>My emotional maturity is off the charts. You just let this sunshine mask fool you? </p>
